Try to reduce dependence on Length(); in particular, try to allow
for `infinite' length.

.MID file support

Test all sources and effects!  So far the following seem OK:

    Noise
    SineWave
    SquareWave
    TriangleWave
    SawToothWave
    Sample
    ClipEnvelope
    SREnvelope
    ADSREnvelope
    Loop
    Transposer
    Amplifier
    Mixer
    Sequence

Add more effects, including Flutter (for tremelo/vibrato), Resample,
	Feedback, Chorus, Reverb, StereoPan,...

Tempo?
