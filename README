This is a set of C++ classes and tcl extensions I wrote for experimenting
with music based upon digital samples. In practice, I found the system
too slow (on a Pentium 100), so I'm not sure what the future of tclmus
is, if any. However, as others may find this stuff useful, I am making
it available for general use under the Gnu Public License Agreement.

Further documentation may be found in:

    CLASSES.TXT  - a description of the C++ classes and implementation
    SCRIPT.TXT - a description of the tcl extensions

tclmus was written on a FreeBSD 2.2.2 system. It should port to other
systems which have DSP devices with little or no effort. All the
system-specific code (what little there is) can be found in the
Drivers/dsp.cc file.
